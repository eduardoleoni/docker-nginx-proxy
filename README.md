# Docker NginX Proxy

Branched of [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy)

A nginx proxy running under Ubuntu, just have the ports from other containers that you want to proxy to point towards 80. E.g "8212:80"

See [Automated Nginx Reverse Proxy for Docker](http://jasonwilder.com/blog/2014/03/25/automated-nginx-reverse-proxy-for-docker/) for why you might want to use this.
